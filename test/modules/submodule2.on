# Submodule 2: Statistical and data processing functions

# Statistical constants
Mean weight: mean_weight = 1.0
Standard deviation factor: std_factor = 0.5

# Variables
X: x = 1
Y: y = 2
Z: z = 3

# Statistical functions
Mean: mean = (x + y + z) / 3
Variance: variance = (x - mean) ^ 2 + (y - mean) ^ 2 + (z - mean) ^ 2
Standard deviation: std_dev = sqrt(variance)

# Data processing functions
Normalize: normalize = (x - mean) / std
Scale: scale = (x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)
Round: round = floor(x + 0.5)

# Aggregation functions
Sum: sum = x + y + z
Count: count = 3
Product: product = x * y * z
