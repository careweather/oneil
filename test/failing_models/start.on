# Top-level model for testing success and failure cases

# Import success models
use success1 as s1
use success2 as s2  
use success3 as s3

# Import failure models (these should fail to parse)
use failure1 as f1
use failure2 as f2
use failure3 as f3

# Main calculations
Main calculation: main = result.s1 + result.s2 + result.s3

# Test section
section Test Results

test: main > 0
test: invalid.f1 + invalid.f2 + invalid.f3 > 0
test: invalid.s1 == 0
